✓ Step Check the current status of the git repository to identify changes. Summary:
Command: git status
Reason: This is the initial step to understand what changes are present in the repository. The output of 'git status' will show modified, 
added, or deleted files, which is essential information for deciding which files to stage and for crafting a meaningful commit message in 
subsequent steps. This command does not produce a very long output and is a standard first step in a git workflow.
Feedback: The `git status` command is a safe and essential read-only operation for understanding the current state of the Git repository. It 
does not modify any files or system configurations, nor does it involve downloading or installing software. This command directly supports the 
overall instruction to "read the changes in the current git repo" by providing the necessary information to proceed with staging and committing
changes. It adheres to all security rules.

Output: 
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   readme.md
        modified:   requirements.txt
        modified:   src/cli.py
        modified:   src/config.py
        modified:   src/executor.py
        modified:   src/llm.py
        modified:   src/planner.py
        modified:   src/validator.py
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
Status: Success (Code: 0)

✓ Step Stage all identified changes in the repository to prepare for committing. Summary:
Command: git add .
Reason: Step 1 (`git status`) successfully identified several modified files that are not yet staged for commit. To proceed with the task of 
committing these changes, they must first be staged. `git add .` is the standard command to stage all modified and new files in the current 
directory and its subdirectories, directly addressing the output of the previous step and moving towards the commit goal. The output of this 
command is usually minimal, indicating success or any issues, and does not produce a very long output.
Feedback: The command `git add .` is a standard and safe operation in Git workflows. It stages all modified and new files in the current 
directory and its subdirectories, preparing them for the next commit. This step is a logical progression after `git status` has identified 
changes and is essential for fulfilling the overall instruction to commit changes. It does not violate any security rules, as it does not 
delete data, reboot systems, or download software. The command is appropriate for the described purpose.

Output: 
No output
Status: Success (Code: 0)

✓ Step Get a summary of the staged changes to help craft a meaningful commit message. Summary:
Command: git diff --staged --stat
Reason: After staging all changes in Step 2, it's crucial to understand the nature of these changes before committing. `git diff --staged 
--stat` provides a concise summary of the modifications (files changed, lines added/deleted), which is essential for creating a meaningful and 
accurate commit message as required by the task. This command avoids producing a very long output while still providing sufficient context. The
output will be used in the next step to formulate the commit message.
Feedback: The command `git diff --staged --stat` is safe and appropriate. It is a read-only command that provides a concise summary of staged 
changes, which is essential for crafting a meaningful commit message as per the overall instruction. It does not violate any security rules, 
nor does it modify, delete, or corrupt any data. The command is well-suited for its described purpose in the current execution context.

✓ Step Commit the staged changes with a meaningful message summarizing the updates. Summary:
Command: git commit -m "Refactor: Enhance core CLI logic, update dependencies and documentation"
Reason: Step 3 (`git diff --staged --stat`) provided a summary of the staged changes, indicating modifications across several core source files
(cli.py, executor.py, llm.py, planner.py, validator.py), as well as readme.md and requirements.txt. This information is used to craft a concise
and meaningful commit message that reflects the nature of these updates. Committing the changes is a direct requirement of the task and follows
logically after staging and reviewing the changes. The output of this command will confirm the commit and will be used in the next step to 
verify the commit was successful before pushing.
Feedback: The `git commit` command is safe and appropriate. It directly addresses the instruction to 'make a meaningful commit message and 
commit the changes'. The commit message 'Refactor: Enhance core CLI logic, update dependencies and documentation' is well-crafted and reflects 
the changes identified in the previous `git diff --staged --stat` command, which showed modifications to core CLI files, documentation, and 
dependencies. This step is a logical progression after staging changes and reviewing them.

Output: 
 Refactor: Enhance core CLI logic, update dependencies and documentation
 8 files changed, 331 insertions(+), 166 deletions(-)
Status: Success (Code: 0)

✓ Step Push the committed changes to the remote 'origin' repository. Summary:
Command: git push origin master
Reason: Step 4 successfully committed the staged changes. The final requirement of the task is to 'push to origin'. This command will push the 
local 'master' branch (as indicated by 'git status' in Step 1) to the 'origin' remote, thereby completing the entire task. The output will 
confirm the success or failure of the push operation.
Feedback: The `git push origin master` command is appropriate and safe in this context. It directly fulfills the final requirement of the 
overall instruction to 'push to origin' after the changes have been successfully committed in the previous step. This command does not violate 
any security rules, as it's a standard operation for synchronizing local commits with a remote repository and does not involve data deletion, 
corruption, or software installation.
